[Verse 1: Chillindude829]
	I'm not lawful, make this pussy stop talking
	You're not one of the gods, you're one of the god awful
	We all gawking when looking at your fox
	Take it to Smash 4 and lose it by four stocks
	Not standing your style
	You ain't standing your ground
	Get wins while kicking a man when he's down
	Like, "I beat mango, I'm the favorite if he chokes!
	As far as Armada goes, I'll just wait 'til he's a host."
	Ain't no telling how foolish you'll be looking
	Evidence dot zip can't contain the ass whooping
	Right when we realize the money match is over
	That will be your cue to throw your controller
[Verse 2: Chillindude829]
	Expose you as a fraud
	Yeah I'll be blowing you up
	Who said you were a god?
	I know it wasn't Plup
	Been here ten years and you know I'm showing up
	For a man of many words, I think you've said enough
	But, The only way to make you hush
	I'll body bag your fox then Dot zip it shut
	Put you in your place
	Kid, you're a disgrace
	Get killed quick like that missile hit you in the face
	After all of this you'll be watching your mouth
	Ain't no telling who'll be calling you out
	When salty suite comes down
	You better come correct
	Until you win a major show your elders some respect
[Verse 3: Chillindude829]
	P.S. Leffen I ain't done yet
	I'm the underdog so place your bets
	Who ever want to see Leffen looking dumb
	Throw your money on the line cause I'm making some
	Gotta say bro you're looking awfully weak
	Wait and see what happens at the salty suite
	Vanilla fox don't suit you so go find another
	Teach you a lesson and take back my color
